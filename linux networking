cron job for every 10 minutes, disable ICMP "Destination Net Unreachable" so clients don't know the WAN is going to go down,
then restart WAN connection (in this case wwan in OpenWRT), then enable ICMP Destination Net Unreachable for actual network down situation.
It works, but fucks with any network monitoring you may want to do.
